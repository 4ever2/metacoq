(** * Type checker for PCUIC without fuel

  *WIP*

  The idea is to subsume PCUICChecker by providing a fuel-free implementation
  of reduction, conversion and type checking.

  We will follow the same structure, except that we assume normalisation of
  the system. Since we will be using an axiom to justify termination, the checker
  won't run inside Coq, however, its extracted version should correspond more or less
  to the current implementation in ocaml, except it will be certified.

    cofix_ : bool
  }.

  Definition default := mk true true true true true true.

End RedFlags.

(* We assume normalisation of the reduction.

   We state is as well-foundedness of the reduction.
   This seems to be slightly stronger than simply assuming there are no infinite paths.
   This is however the version we need to do well-founded recursion.
